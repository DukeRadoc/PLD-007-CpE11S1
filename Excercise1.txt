Q : Who are the noteable inventors of hardware and software? cite atleast 5 software developers and 5 hardware developers
A : 
Hardware:
My most noteable and i think underrated names in the hardware game is 
american engineer "Douglas Englebert" with his co-inventor: swiss computer programmer "Rene Sommer", "Jean-Daniel Nicoud", and "Andre Guignard" or the team behind THe Mousee.
and another one would be "Philip Don Estrige" or Don estrige whos also knows as "The father of IBM" or the computers behind our history that was used by the government to handle all sorts of things from aeronautical, defense systems, and the IBM 7094 which was used to have robots sing for the first time.
Software :
For soft ware developers the people that stuck out to me the most has to be 
the face of facebook himself mr "Mark Zuckerberg" practically the man behind 20th century streamlined social media that exploded what its predecessors "friendster", "myspace" and other websites couldnt.
Another big name would be "Bill Gates" and "Paul G. Allen". the two people behind microsoft. the leading software aside from our other competitor "Tim Cook" or the head behing apple.
although not as revolutionary as the others "Ellon Musk" deserves as spot on this list for as of today hes spear heading the AI race to its capacity and it is obviously the next step into our technology.
